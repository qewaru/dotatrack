# dotatrack Full Stack app
My second project focused on making API requests. Most of code was written using Node.js and Express.js.
On the index page, users can switch between two search bars to find information about professional teams or players in the game DoTa 2.

## Used languages and modules
### Languages
* Express.js
* Node.js
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
### Node.js modules
* Express.js
* Axios
* Zlib
* Mongoose

## Features
* Search for any team and player: users are able to find information about any proffesional team or player from huge list.
* OpenDota API: it provides tons of detalied information

## Future updates
In the future, I plan to add couple of updates to dotatrack:

* Account system: users will be able create their own account and profile "card".
* User search bar: based on the account system update, users will be able to search for their or other users DoTa 2 profiles.
* Match search bar: users can find any match ID (generated in-game) and search for match data on website.
### Bugs to fix
CSS: on some devices player and team "cards" display incorrectly
