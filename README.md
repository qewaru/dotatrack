# dotatrack Full Stack app
My second project focused on API requests. Most of code was written on Node.js and Express.js.
On the index page users can switch between two search bars where they can type Professional team or player from game DoTa 2.

## Used languages
* Express.js
* Node.js
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript
### Used Node.js modules
* Express.js
* Axios
* Zlib
* Mongoose

## Future updates
* Account system - users will be able create their own account and profile "card".
* User search bar - based on previous update, users will be able to search for their or other user DoTa 2 profiles.
* Match search bar - users can find any match id (that is generated in-game) and search for match data on website.
